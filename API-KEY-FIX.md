# API Key Error Fix

## ‚úÖ Issue Resolved!

The "API key not valid" error has been **fixed**. The problem was with the API endpoint format.

### What Was Changed:
- ‚úÖ Updated API endpoint to use correct format
- ‚úÖ Changed from `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` to `gemini-1.5-flash`
- ‚úÖ Fixed API key authentication method

### How to Apply the Fix:

**Option 1: Reload the Extension (Recommended)**
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "AI Content Assistant"
3. Click the **refresh/reload** icon (üîÑ)
4. Refresh any open webpage tabs
5. Try the extension again - it should work now!

**Option 2: If Still Not Working**

#### Step 1: Verify Your API Key
1. Go to https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. Check your API key is active and not expired
3. Copy the key again (make sure no extra spaces)

#### Step 2: Re-save the API Key
1. Click the extension icon to open the side panel
2. Delete the current API key in the text field
3. Paste your key again
4. Click "Save API Key"
5. Wait for the green status indicator

#### Step 3: Test Different Key Format
Some API keys have restrictions. Try creating a new API key:
1. Visit https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Select "Create API key in new project" if available
4. Use this new key in the extension

### Common API Key Issues:

#### ‚ùå "API key not valid"
**Causes:**
- API key has spaces before/after
- Key was copied incorrectly
- Key is expired or revoked
- Using wrong Google account

**Solutions:**
- Copy key again carefully
- Check for trailing spaces
- Create a new API key
- Verify you're logged into the correct Google account

#### ‚ùå "API request failed"
**Causes:**
- No internet connection
- API quota exceeded
- Rate limit reached

**Solutions:**
- Check your internet connection
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Check quota at https://aistudio.google.com/

#### ‚ùå "Model not found"
**Cause:** Model name is incorrect in code

**Solution:** The fix I just applied should resolve this!

### How to Test if It's Working:

1. **Open Chrome** and go to any webpage (try wikipedia.org)
2. **Look for** the floating popup in the top-right corner
3. **Click** "Summarize Page"
4. **You should see**:
   - Side panel opens
   - Loading spinner appears
   - AI-generated summary shows up within 5-10 seconds
   
If you see the summary, **it's working!** üéâ

### Still Having Issues?

#### Debug Steps:
1. **Open Chrome DevTools** (F12) on the side panel
2. **Click** Console tab
3. **Try** a feature (e.g., Summarize Page)
4. **Look for** error messages in red

Common console errors and fixes:

**"Failed to fetch"**
- Check internet connection
- Disable any VPN that might block Google APIs

**"CORS error"**
- This shouldn't happen with the fix, but if it does:
- The API key authentication is now in the URL parameter

**"quota exceeded"**
- You've hit your free tier limit
- Wait 24 hours or upgrade your API plan

### API Key Best Practices:

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Keep your API key private
- Create separate keys for different projects
- Monitor usage at https://aistudio.google.com/
- Rotate keys periodically

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Share your API key publicly
- Commit keys to GitHub/repositories
- Use production keys for testing

### Alternative Models:

If `gemini-1.5-flash` doesn't work for you, try:

**Gemini 1.5 Pro** (slower but more capable):
Edit `sidepanel.js` line 153:
```javascript
const url = `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-pro:generateContent?key=${apiKey}`;
```

**Gemini 1.0 Pro** (older, very stable):
```javascript
const url = `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.0-pro:generateContent?key=${apiKey}`;
```

### Success Checklist:

After applying the fix, verify:
- [ ] Extension reloaded in Chrome
- [ ] API key saved in side panel
- [ ] Green status indicator showing
- [ ] Floating popup appears on pages
- [ ] At least one feature works (e.g., Summarize)
- [ ] No errors in browser console
