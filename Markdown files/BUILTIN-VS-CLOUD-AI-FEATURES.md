# Built-in AI vs Cloud AI Feature Support

## Summary of Changes
Updated the side panel to properly check which AI provider is active before requiring API keys or blocking features. The Settings tab now clearly shows which features are included with each AI provider.

## Features by AI Provider

### ✅ Works with BOTH Built-in AI and Cloud AI

1. **Chat with Page** (Chat tab)
   - Send messages and get responses
   - Context-aware conversations about the current page
   - Uses: Prompt API (built-in) or Gemini API (cloud)

2. **Text Field Assistant** (All buttons)
   - Fix grammar
   - Rewrite tone (clear, casual, formal, shorter)
   - Rephrase (uses Rewriter API when available)
   - Translate
   - All selection popup features

3. **Organize Bookmarks**
   - Analyzes and groups bookmarks
   - Uses: Prompt API (built-in) or Gemini API (cloud)

4. **YouTube Summaries**
   - Summarize video transcripts
   - Uses: Summarizer API (built-in) or Gemini API (cloud)

5. **Page Translation**
   - Translate entire pages
   - Uses: Translator API (built-in) or Gemini API (cloud)

6. **Page Summarization**
   - Summarize page content
   - Uses: Summarizer API (built-in) or Gemini API (cloud)

### ✅ Works with BOTH (with different methods)

1. **Chat with PDF**
   - Built-in AI: Extracts actual text from PDF (works with text-based PDFs)
   - Cloud AI: Uses OCR on screenshots (works with image-based PDFs too)
   - Automatically chooses the right method based on active provider

### ❌ Requires Cloud AI ONLY

1. **Call Mindy** (Voice Assistant)
   - Reason: Requires audio input and real-time streaming
   - Built-in AI doesn't support audio input yet

2. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**
   - Reason: Uses Gemini's specialized TTS model
   - Built-in AI doesn't have TTS capability

3. **Image Explanation**
   - Reason: Requires multimodal (vision) support
   - Built-in AI doesn't support image input yet

4. **Image Text Extraction (OCR)**
   - Reason: Requires multimodal (vision) support
   - Built-in AI doesn't support image input yet

## API Key Requirements

### Built-in AI Selected
- ✅ No API key required for most features
- ❌ API key required only for cloud-only features (if user tries to use them)

### Cloud AI Selected
- ❌ API key required for all features
- Shows alert: "Please configure your API key first!"

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Changes
- All features required API key, even when built-in AI was selected
- Users couldn't use chat or other features without configuring cloud API
- No clear indication of which features work with which provider

### After Changes
- Built-in AI features work immediately without API key
- Cloud-only features show helpful message: "This feature requires Cloud AI. Please switch to Cloud AI in Settings."
- API key only required when actually using cloud AI
- **Settings tab now shows feature lists:**
  - Built-in AI section lists: Chat, PDF (text), Grammar, Translation, Summarization, Rewriting, YouTube, Bookmarks
  - Cloud API section shows: "Everything in Built-in AI, plus:" Voice Assistant, PDF OCR, Image features, TTS

## Technical Implementation

### API Key Check Pattern (Updated)

**For features that work with both:**
```javascript
// Check if API key is needed (only for cloud AI)
const manager = await initializeSidePanelProviderManager();
const activeProvider = manager.getActiveProvider();

if (activeProvider === 'cloud' && !apiKey) {
  alert('Please configure your API key first!');
  return;
}
```

**For cloud-only features:**
```javascript
// Feature requires cloud AI
const manager = await initializeSidePanelProviderManager();
const activeProvider = manager.getActiveProvider();

if (activeProvider !== 'cloud') {
  alert('This feature requires Cloud AI. Please switch to Cloud AI in Settings.');
  return;
}

if (!apiKey) {
  alert('Please configure your API key first!');
  return;
}
```

## Files Modified

1. **sidepanel.js**
   - Updated `sendChatMessage()` - Chat now works with built-in AI
   - Updated `startMindyCall()` - Shows cloud-only message
   - Updated `explainImage()` - Shows cloud-only message
   - Updated `extractImageText()` - Shows cloud-only message
   - Updated `generateTextToSpeech()` - Shows cloud-only message
   - Updated `organizeBookmarks()` - Works with built-in AI

## Testing

### To Test Built-in AI Features:
1. Go to Settings tab
2. Select "Built-in AI (Gemini Nano)"
3. Try these features (should work without API key):
   - Send a chat message
   - Use text field assistant buttons
   - Organize bookmarks
   - Summarize YouTube videos
   - Translate pages

### To Test Cloud-Only Features:
1. With built-in AI selected, try:
   - Call Mindy → Should show "requires Cloud AI" message
   - Image explanation → Should show "requires Cloud AI" message
   - Text-to-Speech → Should show "requires Cloud AI" message

2. Switch to Cloud AI and configure API key
3. All features should now work

## Future Enhancements

When Chrome's built-in AI adds support for:
- **Audio input** → Enable Mindy with built-in AI
- **Multimodal/Vision** → Enable image features with built-in AI
- **Audio output** → Enable TTS with built-in AI

These features can be updated to support both providers.
