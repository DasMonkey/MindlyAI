## Step 1: Check Console Logs

### Open DevTools Console:
1. Press **F12** or right-click ‚Üí **Inspect**
2. Click the **Console** tab
3. Type some text with errors in a text field
4. Look for these logs:

### Expected Logs (Everything Working):
```
üîç Grammar Checker initialized
üìù FieldChecker: Checking grammar for text: I seen him...
üì§ Sending grammar check request to background
üì• Received grammar check response: {...}
‚úÖ Returning 1 errors: [{...}]
üé® FieldChecker: Showing underlines for 1 errors
```

### If You See:
- ‚ùå **No logs at all** ‚Üí Grammar checker not loaded (see Step 2)
- ‚ùå **"Extension context invalidated"** ‚Üí Reload extension (see Step 3)
- ‚ùå **"Could not establish connection"** ‚Üí Extension not running (see Step 3)
- ‚ùå **"Returning 0 errors"** ‚Üí AI thinks text is correct (see Step 4)

---

## Step 2: Verify Extension is Loaded

### Check Extension Status:
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "Mentelo"
3. Make sure it's **Enabled** (toggle should be blue)
4. Check for any error messages

### If Extension Shows Errors:
1. Click **Details**
2. Look at the error messages
3. Click **Reload** button
4. Refresh the test page

---

## Step 3: Reload Everything

2. **Reload Test Page:**
   - Press **F5** or **Ctrl+R**

3. **Clear Console:**
   - In DevTools Console, click the üö´ icon

4. **Test Again:**
   - Type: "I seen him yesterday"
   - Wait 1 second
   - Check for underlines

---

## Step 4: Test with Obvious Errors

The AI might think your text is correct. Try these **guaranteed errors**:

### Test Examples:
```
I seen him yesterday          ‚Üê "seen" should be "saw"
He dont like pizza            ‚Üê "dont" should be "doesn't"
She go to school everyday     ‚Üê "go" should be "goes"
They was happy                ‚Üê "was" should be "were"
```

### Copy-Paste Test:
1. Copy one of the examples above
2. Paste into any text field
3. Wait 1 second
4. Red underlines should appear

---

## Step 5: Check AI Provider Settings

### Verify Built-in AI is Selected:
1. Click the Mentelo extension icon
2. Open the side panel
3. Go to **Settings** section
4. Check **AI Provider** is set to "Built-in AI (Gemini Nano)"

### Check Provider Status:
1. In side panel, go to **Provider Status**
2. Look for:
   - **Prompt API**: Should show ‚úÖ Available
   - **Proofreader API**: May show ‚úÖ Available or ‚ùå Unavailable (both OK)

### If Prompt API is Unavailable:
1. Go to `chrome://on-device-internals`
2. Check if Gemini Nano is downloaded
3. If not, click "Download" and wait
4. Reload extension after download

---

## Step 6: Use Test Page

### Open the Test Page:
1. Open `test-grammar-checker.html` in Chrome
2. Open DevTools Console (F12)
3. Type text with errors in the textarea
4. Watch console for logs

### What the Test Page Shows:
- ‚úÖ Grammar checker initialization status
- ‚úÖ Detailed console logs for debugging
- ‚úÖ Test examples to copy-paste
- ‚úÖ Troubleshooting tips

---

## Step 7: Check for Conflicts

### Disable Other Extensions:
Some extensions might interfere with grammar checking:
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Temporarily disable other extensions
3. Test grammar checker again
4. Re-enable extensions one by one to find conflicts

### Common Conflicts:
- Other grammar checkers (Grammarly, LanguageTool)
- Text enhancement extensions
- Content blockers

---

## Step 8: Check Chrome Version

### Minimum Requirements:
- **Chrome 128+** for Prompt API
- **Chrome 141+** for Proofreader API

### Check Your Version:
1. Go to `chrome://settings/help`
2. Look at version number
3. Update if needed

---

## Step 9: Manual Debug Test

### Test the Backend Directly:

Open DevTools Console and run:

```javascript
// Test if grammar checker exists
console.log('Grammar Checker:', window.grammarChecker);

// Test checkText method
if (window.grammarChecker) {
  window.grammarChecker.checkText('I seen him yesterday').then(errors => {
    console.log('Errors found:', errors);
  });
}
```

### Expected Output:
```javascript
Errors found: [
  {
    error: "seen",
    correction: "saw",
    type: "grammar",
    message: "Use past tense 'saw'"
  }
]
```

---

## Step 10: Check Background Script

### Open Background Service Worker:
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find Mentelo
3. Click **Details**
4. Click **Inspect views: service worker**
5. Look for errors in console

### Expected Logs:
```
üìù Background: Handling grammar check request
‚úÖ Background: Grammar check successful
```

### If You See Errors:
- Note the error message
- Check if it's an API availability issue
- Verify AI provider is initialized

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "No errors found" but text has obvious errors

**Cause:** AI is being too lenient or not understanding context

**Solution:**
1. Try more obvious errors
2. Use complete sentences
3. Check if AI provider is working: Open side panel ‚Üí Test AI

---

### Issue: Underlines appear but disappear immediately

**Cause:** Text is changing or overlay is being removed

**Solution:**
1. Check console for "removing overlay" messages
2. Verify no other scripts are modifying the text field
3. Try on a simple page (use test-grammar-checker.html)

---

### Issue: Works on some sites but not others

**Cause:** Site-specific CSS or JavaScript conflicts

**Solution:**
1. Check if text field is detected: Look for "FieldChecker" logs
2. Try different text fields on the same site
3. Check if site has Content Security Policy blocking the extension

---

### Issue: "Extension context invalidated"

**Cause:** Extension was reloaded while page was open

**Solution:**
1. Reload the extension: `chrome://extensions/` ‚Üí Reload
2. Reload the page: Press F5
3. Test again

---

## Still Not Working?

### Collect Debug Information:

1. **Console Logs:**
   - Copy all console logs from DevTools
   - Include both page console and background console

2. **Extension Status:**
   - Screenshot of `chrome://extensions/` showing Mentelo
   - Screenshot of side panel Provider Status

3. **Test Results:**
   - What text did you type?
   - What happened (or didn't happen)?
   - Any error messages?

4. **System Info:**
   - Chrome version
   - Operating system
   - Any other extensions installed?
