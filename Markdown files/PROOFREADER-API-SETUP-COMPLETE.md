## What We Did

1. ‚úÖ Registered for Proofreader API Origin Trial
2. ‚úÖ Got your token (expires May 19, 2026)
3. ‚úÖ Added token to `manifest.json`

## Next Steps to Activate

### Step 1: Enable Chrome Flag
1. Open Chrome and go to: `chrome://flags/#proofreader-api-for-gemini-nano`
2. Set it to **Enabled**
3. Click **Relaunch** to restart Chrome

### Step 2: Reload Your Extension
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "Mentelo"
3. Click the **Reload** button (circular arrow icon)

### Step 3: Test the Proofreader API
1. Open the test page: `test-proofreader-api.html`
2. It should now show "‚úÖ Proofreader API is AVAILABLE" or "üì• Downloadable"
3. If downloadable, click "Download Model" and wait
4. Once available, click "Test Proofreader" to see it work!

### Step 4: Check the Dashboard

## Your Token Details

- **Extension ID:** `cdccdjabgkfoopgbbacodhlflebdhdjj`
- **Token Expires:** May 19, 2026 (Chrome 146)
- **Trial Available:** Up to Chrome 146

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **The Proofreader API is still experimental:**
- It may change or break during the trial
- It will stop working after May 19, 2026
- Your current grammar checker (using Prompt API) will continue to work as a fallback

## What Happens Next?

Your extension now has access to the Proofreader API, but:
- **Your grammar checker still uses Prompt API** (by design)
- The Proofreader API is available if you want to switch to it
- The dashboard will now show the correct Proofreader API status

## Should You Switch to Proofreader API?

**My recommendation: Keep using Prompt API for now**

Reasons:
1. ‚úÖ Prompt API works great for grammar checking
2. ‚úÖ More flexible (custom prompts)
3. ‚úÖ Available in more Chrome versions (128+ vs 141+)
4. ‚úÖ Won't expire in May 2026
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Proofreader API is experimental and may change

**When to switch:**
- When Proofreader API becomes stable (not in Origin Trial)
- When it's available in all Chrome versions
- When you want to use its native format instead of custom prompts

## Testing

To test if the Proofreader API is working:
```bash
# Open test page
test-proofreader-api.html
```

The test page will:
1. Check if Proofreader API exists
2. Show availability status
3. Let you download the model if needed
4. Test proofreading functionality

## Troubleshooting

**If Proofreader API doesn't show up:**
1. Make sure you're on Chrome 141+
2. Enable the flag: `chrome://flags/#proofreader-api-for-gemini-nano`
3. Reload your extension
4. Restart Chrome

**If it says "Not supported":**
- You need Chrome 141 or higher
- The Origin Trial is only for Chrome 141-146

## Summary

üéâ **You're all set!** The Proofreader API token is now in your extension. Enable the Chrome flag, reload the extension, and test it out!
